* security improvements
  * Clean up reset password token whenever e-mail or password changes. thanks to George Deglin & Dennis Charles Hackethal for reporting this bug
  * Ensure empty `authenticable_salt` cannot be used as remember token. This bug can only affect users who manually implement their own `authenticable_salt` and allow empty values as salt

* enhancements
  * The hint about minimum password length required both `@validatable` and `@minimum_password_length` variables on the views, it now uses only the latter. If you have generated the views relying on the `@validatable` variable, replace it with `@minimum_password_length`.
  * Added an ActiveSupport load hook for `:devise_controller`. (by @nakhli)
  * Location fragments are now preserved between requests. (by @jbourassa)
  * Added an `after_remembered` callback for the Rememerable module. (by @BM5k)

  * `confirm!` has been deprecated in favor of `confirm`.
  * `reset_password!` has been deprecated in favor of `reset_password`.
  * `Devise.bcrypt` has been deprecated in favor of `Devise::Encryptor.digest`".

### 3.4.1 - 2014-10-29

* enhancements
  * Devise default views now have a similar markup to Rails scaffold views. (by @udaysinghcode, @cllns)

    the `flash.now` Hash. (by @hbriggs)
* bugfixes

  config is a Hash. (by @lucasmazza)

### 3.4.0 - 2014-10-03

* enhancements
  * Support added for Rails 4.2. Devise now depends on the `responders` gem due
    the extraction of the `respond_with` API from Rails. (by @lucasmazza)
  * The Simple Form templates follow the same change from 3.3.0 by using `Log in` and adding
    a hint about the minimum password length when `validatable` is enabled. (by @aried3r)
  * Controller generator added as `devise:controllers SCOPE`. You can use the `-c` flag
    to pick which controllers (`unlocks`, `confirmations`, etc) you want to generate. (by @Chun-Yang)
  * Removed the hardcoded references for "email" in the flash messages. If you are using
    different attributes as the `authentication_keys` they will be interpolated in the
    messages instead. (by @timoschilling)
* bug fix
  * Fixed a regression where the devise generator would fail with a `ConnectionNotEstablished`
    exception when executed inside a mountable engine. (by @lucasmazza)

  * Ensure all causes of failed login have the same error message (by @pjungwir)

    message for your users. To keep the current behavior, this flag is now `true`
    by default. (by @lucasmazza)

### 3.3.0 - 2014-08-13

* enhancements
  * Support multiple warden configuration blocks on devise configuration. (by @rossta)
  * Previously, when a user signed out, all remember me tokens for all sessions/browsers would be
    invalidated, and this behavior could not be changed. This behavior is now configurable via
    `expire_all_remember_me_on_sign_out`. The default continues to be true. (by @laurocaetano)
  * Default email messages was updated with grammar fixes, check the diff on
    #2906 for the updated copy (by @p-originate)
  * Allow a resource to be found based on its encrypted password token (by @karlentwistle)
  * Adds `devise_group`, a macro to define controller helpers for multiple mappings at once. (by @dropletzz)
  * The default views now use `Log in` instead of `Sign in` and have a hint about the minimum password length if
    the current scope is using the `validatable` module (by @alexsoble)

* bug fix
  * Check if there is a signed in user before executing the `SessionsController#destroy`.
  * `SessionsController#destroy` no longer yields the `resource` to receiving block,
    since the resource isn't loaded in the action. If you need access to the current
    resource when overring the action use the scope helper (like `current_user`) before
    calling `super`
  * Serialize the `last_request_at` entry as an Integer
  * Ensure registration controller block yields happen on failure in addition to success (by @dpehrson)
  * Only valid paths will be stored for redirections (by @parallel588)

### 3.2.4 - 2014-03-17

* enhancements
  * `bcrypt` dependency updated due https://github.com/codahale/bcrypt-ruby/pull/86.

### 3.2.3 - 2014-02-20

* enhancements
  * Devise will use the `secret_key_base` on Rails 4+ applications as its `secret_key`.
    You can change this and use your own secret by changing the `devise.rb` initializer.

* bug fix
  * Migrations will be properly generated when using rails 4.1.0.

### 3.2.2 - 2013-11-25

  * Separate redirects and flash messages in `navigational_formats` and `flashing_formats` (by @ssendev)

* bug fix

  * Splat the arguments to `strong_parameters#permit` to work around a limitation in the `strong_parameters` gem (by @memberful)
  * Omniauth now uses `mapping.fullpath` when generating routes. This means if you call `devise_for :users` inside a scope, like `scope "/api"`, the scope will now apply to the omniauth route (by @AlexanderZaytsev)
  * Ensure timeoutable hook respects `Devise.sign_out_all_scopes` configuration

* deprecations

Security announcement: http://blog.plataformatec.com.br/2013/08/devise-3-1-now-with-more-secure-defaults/

* backwards incompatible changes
  * Do not store confirmation, unlock and reset password tokens directly in the database. This means tokens previously stored in the database are no longer valid. You can reenable this temporarily by setting `config.allow_insecure_token_lookup = true` in your configuration file. It is recommended to keep this configuration set to true just temporarily in your production servers only to aid migration
  * The Devise mailer and its views were changed to explicitly receive a token argument as `@token`. You will need to update your mailers and re-copy the views to your application with `rails g devise:views`

* enhancements
  * Add after_confirmation callback

* bug fix
  * When using rails 3.2, the generator adds 'attr_accessible' to the model (by @jcoyne)

  * Fix a bug when procs are used as default mailer in Devise (by @tomasv)

* backwards incompatible changes
