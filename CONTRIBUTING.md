### Please read before contributing

1) Do not post questions in the issues tracker. If you have any questions about Devise, search the [Wiki](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise/wiki) or use the [Mailing List](https://groups.google.com/group/plataformatec-devise) or [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/devise).

2) If you find a security bug, **DO NOT** submit an issue here. Please send an e-mail to [opensource@plataformatec.com.br](mailto:opensource@plataformatec.com.br) instead.

3) If possible, replicate your issue with our
[guides/bug_report_templates/integration_test.rb](test case example), and attach
it to your issue or Pull Request - this way we have an isolated way to replicate
your issue and investigate it further.

4) Do a small search on the issues tracker before submitting your issue to see if it was already reported / fixed.

5) When reporting an issue, include Rails, Devise and Warden versions. If you are getting exceptions, please include the full backtrace.

6) Notice that all of your interactions in the project are expected to follow our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

That's it! The more information you give, the easier it becomes for us to track it down and fix it.
Ideally, you should provide an application that reproduces the error or a test case to Devise's suite.

Thanks!
