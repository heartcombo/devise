Fork of [plataformatec / devise](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise) v2.1.0
Includes an enhancement to automatically update a user's stored encrypted password if the stretches (password hash cost) config parameter is changed. This gives the user an immediate benefit on the 2nd subsequent login where otherwise they would have to change their password to get this benefit.
