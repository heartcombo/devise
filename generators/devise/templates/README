Some setup you must do manually if you haven't yet:

1. Setup defaut url options for your specific environment. Here is an example of development environment:

    config.action_mailer.default_url_options = { :host => 'localhost:3000' }

It's a Rails required configuration. In production it must be the actual host your application is deployed to.

2. Setup default sender for mails. In config/environment.rb:

    DeviseMailer.sender = "test@example.com"

You can also configure this value by running script/generate devise_install and setting config.mailer_sender,

3. Ensure you have defined root_url to *something* in your config/routes.rb:

    map.root :controller => 'home'
