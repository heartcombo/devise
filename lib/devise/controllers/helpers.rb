      # access that specific controller/action.
      # Example:
      #
      #   Roles:
      #     User
      #     Admin
      #
      #   Generated methods:
      #     authenticate_user!  # Signs user in or redirect
      #     authenticate_admin! # Signs admin in or redirect
      #     user_signed_in?     # Checks whether there is a user signed in or not
      #     admin_signed_in?    # Checks whether there is an admin signed in or not
      #     current_user        # Current signed in user
      #     current_admin       # Current signed in admin
