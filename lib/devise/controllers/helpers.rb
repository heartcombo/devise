        #
        #   inside BlogsController (or any other controller, it doesn't matter which):
        #     devise_group :blogger, contains: [:user, :admin]

        #     blogger_signed_in?     # Checks whether there is either a user or an admin signed in
        #     current_blogger        # Currently signed in user or admin
        #     current_bloggers       # Currently signed in user and admin
        #
        #   Use:
        #     before_action :authenticate_blogger!              # Redirects unless either a user or an admin are authenticated
        #     before_action ->{ authenticate_blogger! :admin }  # Redirects to the admin login page
