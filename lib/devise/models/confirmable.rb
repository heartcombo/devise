    # Confirmable is responsible to verify if an account is already confirmed to
    # sign in, and to send emails with confirmation instructions.
    # Confirmation instructions are sent to the user email after creating a
    # record, after updating it's email and also when manually requested by
    # a new confirmation instruction request.
    # Whenever the user update it's email, his account is automatically unconfirmed,
    # it means it won't be able to sign in again without confirming the account
    # again through the email that was sent.
    #
    # Configuration:
    #
    #   confirm_within: the time you want the user will have to confirm it's account
    #                   without blocking his access. When confirm_within is zero, the
    #                   user won't be able to sign in without confirming. You can
    #                   use this to let your user access some features of your
    #                   application without confirming the account, but blocking it
    #                   after a certain period (ie 7 days). By default confirm_within is
    #                   zero, it means users always have to confirm to sign in.
    #
    # Examples:
    #
    #   User.find(1).confirm!      # returns true unless it's already confirmed
    #   User.find(1).confirmed?    # true/false
    #   User.find(1).send_confirmation_instructions # manually send instructions
    #   User.find(1).resend_confirmation! # generates a new token and resent it
