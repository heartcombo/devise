module Devise

    # Handles blocking a user access after a certain number of attempts.
    # Lockable accepts two different strategies to unlock a user after it's
    # blocked: email and time. The former will send an email to the user when
    # the lock happens, containing a link to unlock its account. The second
    # will unlock the user automatically after some configured time (ie 2.hours).
    # It's also possible to setup lockable to use both email and time strategies.
    #
    # == Options
    #
    # Lockable adds the following options to +devise+:
    #
    #   * +maximum_attempts+: how many attempts should be accepted before blocking the user.
    #   * +lock_strategy+: lock the user account by :failed_attempts or :none.
    #   * +unlock_strategy+: unlock the user account by :time, :email, :both or :none.
    #   * +unlock_in+: the time you want to lock the user after to lock happens. Only available when unlock_strategy is :time or :both.
    #   * +unlock_keys+: the keys you want to use when locking and unlocking an account
