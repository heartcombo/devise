    # Rememberable manages generating and clearing token for remember the user
    # from a saved cookie. Rememberable also has utility methods for dealing
    # with serializing the user into the cookie and back from the cookie, trying
    # to lookup the record based on the saved information.
    # You probably wouldn't use rememberable methods directly, they are used
    # mostly internally for handling the remember token.
    #
    # == Options
    #
    # Rememberable adds the following options in devise_for:
    #
    #   * +remember_for+: the time you want the user will be remembered without
    #     asking for credentials. After this time the user will be blocked and
    #     will have to enter his credentials again. This configuration is also
    #     used to calculate the expires time for the cookie created to remember
    #     the user. By default remember_for is 2.weeks.
    #
    #   * +remember_across_browsers+: if a valid remember token can be re-used
    #     between multiple browsers. By default remember_across_browsers is true
    #     and cannot be turned off if you are using password salt instead of remember
    #     token.
    #
    #   * +extend_remember_period+: if true, extends the user's remember period
    #     when remembered via cookie. False by default.
    #
    #   * +cookie_options+: configuration options passed to the created cookie.
    #
    # == Examples
    #
    #   User.find(1).remember_me!  # regenerating the token
    #   User.find(1).forget_me!    # clearing the token
    #
    #   # generating info to put into cookies
    #   User.serialize_into_cookie(user)
    #
    #   # lookup the user based on the incoming cookie information
    #   User.serialize_from_cookie(cookie_string)
