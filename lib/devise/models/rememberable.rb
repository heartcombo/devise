    # Rememberable manages generating and clearing token for remember the user
    # from a saved cookie. Rememberable also has utility methods for dealing
    # with serializing the user into the cookie and back from the cookie, trying
    # to lookup the record based on the saved information.
    # You probably wouldn't use rememberable methods directly, they are used
    # mostly internally for handling the remember token.
    #
    # Configuration:
    #
    #   remember_for: the time you want the user will be remembered without
    #                 asking for credentials. After this time the user will be
    #                 blocked and will have to enter his credentials again.
    #                 This configuration is also used to calculate the expires
    #                 time for the cookie created to remember the user.
    #                 By default remember_for is 2.weeks.
    #
    #   cookie_options: configuration options passed to the created cookie.
    #
    #
    # Examples:
    #
    #   User.find(1).remember_me!  # regenerating the token
    #   User.find(1).forget_me!    # clearing the token
    #
    #   # generating info to put into cookies
    #   User.serialize_into_cookie(user)
    #
    #   # lookup the user based on the incoming cookie information
    #   User.serialize_from_cookie(cookie_string)
