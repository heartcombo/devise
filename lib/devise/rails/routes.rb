  class Mapper
    # Includes devise_for method for routes. This method is responsible to
    # generate all needed routes for devise, based on what modules you have
    # defined in your model.
    #
    # ==== Examples
    #
    # Let's say you have an User model configured to use authenticatable,
    # confirmable and recoverable modules. After creating this inside your routes:
    #
    #   devise_for :users
    #
    # This method is going to look inside your User model and create the
    # needed routes:
    #
    #  # Session routes for Authenticatable (default)
    #       new_user_session GET  /users/sign_in                    {:controller=>"devise/sessions", :action=>"new"}
    #           user_session POST /users/sign_in                    {:controller=>"devise/sessions", :action=>"create"}
    #   destroy_user_session GET  /users/sign_out                   {:controller=>"devise/sessions", :action=>"destroy"}
    #
    #  # Password routes for Recoverable, if User model has :recoverable configured
    #      new_user_password GET  /users/password/new(.:format)     {:controller=>"devise/passwords", :action=>"new"}
    #     edit_user_password GET  /users/password/edit(.:format)    {:controller=>"devise/passwords", :action=>"edit"}
    #          user_password PUT  /users/password(.:format)         {:controller=>"devise/passwords", :action=>"update"}
    #                        POST /users/password(.:format)         {:controller=>"devise/passwords", :action=>"create"}
    #
    #  # Confirmation routes for Confirmable, if User model has :confirmable configured
    #  new_user_confirmation GET  /users/confirmation/new(.:format) {:controller=>"devise/confirmations", :action=>"new"}
    #      user_confirmation GET  /users/confirmation(.:format)     {:controller=>"devise/confirmations", :action=>"show"}
    #                        POST /users/confirmation(.:format)     {:controller=>"devise/confirmations", :action=>"create"}
    #
    # ==== Options
    #
    # You can configure your routes with some options:
    #
    #  * :class_name => setup a different class to be looked up by devise,
    #                   if it cannot be correctly find by the route name.
    #
    #      devise_for :users, :class_name => 'Account'
    #
    #  * :path => allows you to setup path name that will be used, as rails routes does.
    #             The following route configuration would setup your route as /accounts instead of /users:
    #
    #      devise_for :users, :path => 'accounts'
    #
    #  * :singular => setup the singular name for the given resource. This is used as the instance variable name in
    #                 controller, as the name in routes and the scope given to warden.
    #
    #      devise_for :users, :singular => :user
    #
    #  * :path_names => configure different path names to overwrite defaults :sign_in, :sign_out, :sign_up,
    #                   :password, :confirmation, :unlock.
    #
    #      devise_for :users, :path_names => { :sign_in => 'login', :sign_out => 'logout', :password => 'secret', :confirmation => 'verification' }
    #
    #  * :controllers => the controller which should be used. All routes by default points to Devise controllers.
    #    However, if you want them to point to custom controller, you should do:
    #
    #      devise_for :users, :controllers => { :sessions => "users/sessions" }
    #
    #  * :sign_out_via => the HTTP method(s) accepted for the :sign_out action (default: :get),
    #    if you wish to restrict this to accept only :post or :delete requests you should do:
    #
    #      devise_for :users, :sign_out_via => [ :post, :delete ]
    #
    #    You need to make sure that your sign_out controls trigger a request with a matching HTTP method.
    #
    #  * :module => the namespace to find controlers. By default, devise will access devise/sessions,
    #    devise/registrations and so on. If you want to namespace all at once, use module:
    #
    #      devise_for :users, :module => "users"
    #
    #    Notice that whenever you use namespace in the router DSL, it automatically sets the module.
    #    So the following setup:
    #
    #      namespace :publisher
    #        devise_for :account
    #      end
    #
    #    Will use publisher/sessions controller instead of devise/sessions controller. You can revert
    #    this by providing the :module option to devise_for.
    #
    #    Also pay attention that when you use a namespace it will affect all the helpers and methods for controllers
    #    and views. For example, using the above setup you'll end with following methods:
    #    current_publisher_account, authenticate_publisher_account!, pusblisher_account_signed_in, etc.
    #
    #  * :skip => tell which controller you want to skip routes from being created:
    #
    #      devise_for :users, :skip => :sessions
    #
    #  * :only => the opposite of :skip, tell which controllers only to generate routes to:
    #
    #      devise_for :users, :only => :sessions
    #
    #
    # ==== Scoping
    #
    # Following Rails 3 routes DSL, you can nest devise_for calls inside a scope:
    #
    #   scope "/my" do
    #     devise_for :users
    #   end
    #
    # However, since Devise uses the request path to retrieve the current user, it has one caveats.
    # If you are using a dynamic segment, as below:
    #
    #   scope ":locale" do
    #     devise_for :users
    #   end
    #
    # You are required to configure default_url_options in your ApplicationController class level, so
    # Devise can pick it:
    #
    #   class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
    #     def self.default_url_options
    #       { :locale => I18n.locale }
    #     end
    #   end
    #
    # ==== Adding custom actions to override controllers
    # 
    # You can pass a block to devise_for that will add any routes defined in the block to Devise's 
    # list of known actions.  This is important if you add a custom action to a controller that 
    # overrides an out of the box Devise controller.
    # For example:
    #
    #    class RegistrationsController < Devise::RegistrationsController
    #      def update
    #         # do something different here
    #      end
    #
    #      def deactivate
    #        # not a standard action
    #        # deactivate code here
    #      end
    #    end
    #
    # In order to get Devise to recognize the deactivate action, your devise_for entry should look like this,
    #
    #     devise_for :owners, :controllers => { :registrations => "registrations" } do
    #       post "deactivate", :to => "registrations#deactivate", :as => "deactivate_registration"
    #     end
    #
