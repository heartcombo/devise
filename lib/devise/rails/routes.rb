  class Mapper
    # Includes devise_for method for routes. This method is responsible to
    # generate all needed routes for devise, based on what modules you have
    # defined in your model.
    #
    # ==== Examples
    #
    # Let's say you have an User model configured to use authenticatable,
    # confirmable and recoverable modules. After creating this inside your routes:
    #
    #   devise_for :users
    #
    # This method is going to look inside your User model and create the
    # needed routes:
    #
    #  # Session routes for Authenticatable (default)
    #       new_user_session GET    /users/sign_in                    {controller:"devise/sessions", action:"new"}
    #           user_session POST   /users/sign_in                    {controller:"devise/sessions", action:"create"}
    #   destroy_user_session DELETE /users/sign_out                   {controller:"devise/sessions", action:"destroy"}
    #
    #  # Password routes for Recoverable, if User model has :recoverable configured
    #      new_user_password GET    /users/password/new(.:format)     {controller:"devise/passwords", action:"new"}
    #     edit_user_password GET    /users/password/edit(.:format)    {controller:"devise/passwords", action:"edit"}
    #          user_password PUT    /users/password(.:format)         {controller:"devise/passwords", action:"update"}
    #                        POST   /users/password(.:format)         {controller:"devise/passwords", action:"create"}
    #
    #  # Confirmation routes for Confirmable, if User model has :confirmable configured
    #  new_user_confirmation GET    /users/confirmation/new(.:format) {controller:"devise/confirmations", action:"new"}
    #      user_confirmation GET    /users/confirmation(.:format)     {controller:"devise/confirmations", action:"show"}
    #                        POST   /users/confirmation(.:format)     {controller:"devise/confirmations", action:"create"}
    #
    # ==== Routes integration
    #
    # +devise_for+ is meant to play nicely with other routes methods. For example,
    # by calling +devise_for+ inside a namespace, it automatically nests your devise
    # controllers:
    #
    #     namespace :publisher do
    #       devise_for :account
    #     end
    #
    # The snippet above will use publisher/sessions controller instead of devise/sessions
    # controller. You can revert this change or configure it directly by passing the :module
    # option described below to +devise_for+.
    #
    # Also note that when you use a namespace it will affect all the helpers and methods
    # for controllers and views. For example, using the above setup you'll end with
    # following methods: current_publisher_account, authenticate_publisher_account!,
    # publisher_account_signed_in, etc.
    #
    # The only aspect not affect by the router configuration is the model name. The
    # model name can be explicitly set via the :class_name option.
    #
    # ==== Options
    #
    # You can configure your routes with some options:
    #
    #  * class_name: set up a different class to be looked up by devise, if it cannot be
    #    properly found by the route name.
    #
    #      devise_for :users, class_name: 'Account'
    #
    #  * path: allows you to set up path name that will be used, as rails routes does.
    #    The following route configuration would set up your route as /accounts instead of /users:
    #
    #      devise_for :users, path: 'accounts'
    #
    #  * singular: set up the singular name for the given resource. This is used as the helper methods
    #    names in controller ("authenticate_#{singular}!", "#{singular}_signed_in?", "current_#{singular}"
    #    and "#{singular}_session"), as the scope name in routes and as the scope given to warden.
    #
    #      devise_for :admins, singular: :manager
    #
    #      devise_scope :manager do
    #        ...
    #      end
    #
    #      class ManagerController < ApplicationController
    #        before_action authenticate_manager!
    #
    #        def show
    #          @manager = current_manager
    #          ...
    #        end
    #      end
    #
    #  * path_names: configure different path names to overwrite defaults :sign_in, :sign_out, :sign_up,
    #    :password, :confirmation, :unlock.
    #
    #      devise_for :users, path_names: {
    #        sign_in: 'login', sign_out: 'logout',
    #        password: 'secret', confirmation: 'verification',
    #        registration: 'register', edit: 'edit/profile'
    #      }
    #
    #  * controllers: the controller which should be used. All routes by default points to Devise controllers.
    #    However, if you want them to point to custom controller, you should do:
    #
    #      devise_for :users, controllers: { sessions: "users/sessions" }
    #
    #  * failure_app: a rack app which is invoked whenever there is a failure. Strings representing a given
    #    are also allowed as parameter.
    #
    #  * sign_out_via: the HTTP method(s) accepted for the :sign_out action (default: :delete),
    #    if you wish to restrict this to accept only :post or :delete requests you should do:
    #
    #      devise_for :users, sign_out_via: [:get, :post]
    #
    #    You need to make sure that your sign_out controls trigger a request with a matching HTTP method.
    #
    #  * module: the namespace to find controllers (default: "devise", thus
    #    accessing devise/sessions, devise/registrations, and so on). If you want
    #    to namespace all at once, use module:
    #
    #      devise_for :users, module: "users"
    #
    #  * skip: tell which controller you want to skip routes from being created.
    #    It accepts :all as an option, meaning it will not generate any route at all:
    #
    #      devise_for :users, skip: :sessions
    #
    #  * only: the opposite of :skip, tell which controllers only to generate routes to:
    #
    #      devise_for :users, only: :sessions
    #
    #  * skip_helpers: skip generating Devise url helpers like new_session_path(@user).
    #    This is useful to avoid conflicts with previous routes and is false by default.
    #    It accepts true as option, meaning it will skip all the helpers for the controllers
    #    given in :skip but it also accepts specific helpers to be skipped:
    #
    #      devise_for :users, skip: [:registrations, :confirmations], skip_helpers: true
    #      devise_for :users, skip_helpers: [:registrations, :confirmations]
    #
    #  * format: include "(.:format)" in the generated routes? true by default, set to false to disable:
    #
    #      devise_for :users, format: false
    #
    #  * constraints: works the same as Rails' constraints
    #
    #  * defaults: works the same as Rails' defaults
    #
    #  * router_name: allows application level router name to be overwritten for the current scope
    #
    # ==== Scoping
    #
    # Following Rails 3 routes DSL, you can nest devise_for calls inside a scope:
    #
    #   scope "/my" do
    #     devise_for :users
    #   end
    #
    # However, since Devise uses the request path to retrieve the current user,
    # this has one caveat: If you are using a dynamic segment, like so ...
    #
    #   scope ":locale" do
    #     devise_for :users
    #   end
    #
    # you are required to configure default_url_options in your
    # ApplicationController class, so Devise can pick it:
    #
    #   class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
    #     def self.default_url_options
    #       { locale: I18n.locale }
    #     end
    #   end
    #
    # ==== Adding custom actions to override controllers
    #
    # You can pass a block to devise_for that will add any routes defined in the block to Devise's
    # list of known actions.  This is important if you add a custom action to a controller that
    # overrides an out of the box Devise controller.
    # For example:
    #
    #    class RegistrationsController < Devise::RegistrationsController
    #      def update
    #         # do something different here
    #      end
    #
    #      def deactivate
    #        # not a standard action
    #        # deactivate code here
    #      end
    #    end
    #
    # In order to get Devise to recognize the deactivate action, your devise_scope entry should look like this:
    #
    #     devise_scope :owner do
    #       post "deactivate", to: "registrations#deactivate", as: "deactivate_registration"
    #     end
    #
